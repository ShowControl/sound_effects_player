  <!-- XML format lets us add more values without impacting old readers.
       However, if we need to make an incompatible change to an old
       value, having the version number lets us give a good error message
       if an old program tries to read a newer, incompatible, file.
       Every reader must check the version number and reject versions
       it does not know how to read.  The first version of the software
       will accept only version 1. Writers should write later versions
       only if they must say something they cannot express in version 1.
