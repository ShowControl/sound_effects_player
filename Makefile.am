# When sound_effects_player starts up it loads all of the gstreamer
# plugins it needs.  Two of them, gstlooper and gstenvelope, are
# provided as part of sound_effects_player, and are stored
# in ${libdir}/gstreamer-1.0/.  If ${libdir} is /usr/local/lib,
# which is the default, we need the .desktop file to define the
# environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH to be ${libdir}/gstreamer-1.0.
# However, the value of ${libdir} isn't known until install time.
# We use SED to edit the prototype .desktop file, replacing @libdir@
# with the value of ${libdir}.  The resulting .desktop file is then
# placed where desktop files are stored.
