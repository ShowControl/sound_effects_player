<!-- The outer structure name is "show_control" to identify

     we can give a meaningful error message.  -->
<show_control>

  <!-- This is the project file.  Other XML files used by the
       show_control application are equipment, cues, characters, crew,
       script, sounds and sound_sequence. By putting the purpose of the
       file here, we can give a meaningful error message if the user
       tries to read the wrong file.  -->
  <project>

    <!-- XML format lets us add more values without impacting old readers.
	 However, if we need to make an incompatible change to an old
	 value, having the version number lets us give a good error message
	 if an old program tries to read a newer, incompatible, file.
	 Every reader must check the version number and reject versions
	 it does not know how to read.  The first part of the number is
	 incremented on an incompatible change, the second part on a compatible
	 change: one that adds a value that can be ignored by old readers,
	 for example.  When reading, a program will check the first part of
	 the number and adapt its reading to the indicated format.
	 When writing, a program will use the oldest format capable of
	 expressing the information correctly.  The first version of the
	 show_control programs will reject version numbers in which the value
	 before the decimal point is not equal to 1.  -->
