Version 0.43, June 14, 2015
  Implement start-time in the looper.
  
Version 0.42, June 7, 2015
  Only accept a sound's restart command after it has started release.
  
Version 0.41, June 6, 2015
  Use a status bar to display messages.

Version 0.40, June 5, 2015
  Implement max-duration in the looper.

Version 0.39, June 4, 2015
  Add a shutdown message to the looper element.  This lets us send an
  EOS through the pipeline before shutting it down, resulting in
  greater reliability.
  
Version 0.38, May 22, 2015
  Connect the buttons to the terminated and completed messages from the
  gstremer pipeline.  We are now running the pipeline continuously,
  using the looper to drive it and the envelope plugin to shape the
  sound.
  
Version 0.37, May 21, 2015
  Add the looper plugin.
  
Version 0.36, May 5, 2015
  Add support for the release message to the envelope plugin.
  
Version 0.35, May 4, 2015
  Add a volume parameter to the envelope gstreamer plugin.
  
Version 0.34, May 3, 2015
  Add an early version of the envelope plugin.  It doesn't accept release
  messages yet, which will help with EOS handling, but it can do attack,
  decay, sustain, and pre-specified release.
  
Version 0.33, April 5, 2015
  Stop the pipeline when no sounds are playing, and avoid running
  each sound effect's pipeline when it is not playing.  This will reduce the
  normal CPU load, though not the maximum.  Use this to handle EOS.
  
Version 0.32, March 31, 2015
  Play the sounds specified in the project XML file.  This is clumsy because
  we don't have our customer gstreamer plugin, which will allow the pipeline
  to run continuously.  As a result, if the pipeline is allowed to reach
  End of Stream, sounds stop working.
  
Version 0.31, March 26, 2015
  Make the file parameter optional.
  
Version 0.30, March 25, 2015
  Read sound information from an XML file.  We don't do anything with it yet.
  
Version 0.29, March 17, 2015
  Move xml file parsing to its own module.
  
Version 0.28, March 14, 2015
  Read show_control XML files.
  
Version 0.27, February 28, 2015
  Add a preferences dialog.
  
Version 0.26, February 27, 2015
  Add the ability to write the project file.
  
Version 0.25, February 27, 2015
  Convert the project file to XML, and use libxml2 to read it.
  
Version 0.24, February 24, 2015
  Create a better icon.
  
Version 0.23, February 24, 2015
  Rename play_sound to sound_effects_player.
  
Version 0.22, February 24, 2015
  Add some documentation and move to consistent names and idioms in the
  source files.
  
Version 0.21, February 23, 2015
  Listen for UDP datagrams rather than for TCP streams.
  
Version 0.20, February 21, 2015
  Add desktop and icon files to make the application launchable
  from the desktop GUI.
  
Version 0.19, February 19, 2015
  Use the project file to specify the network port.
    
Version 0.18, February 16, 2015
  Make the dependence on GTK+-3.0 version 3.14 clearer.
  Begin work on the Open menu item.
    
Version 0.17, February 15, 2015
  Add a menu bar
  
Version 0.16, February 15, 2015
  Update to current Autoconfigure best practices.
  
Version 0.15, January 27, 2015
  Require version 3.14 of GTK+, due to gtk_application_set_accels_for_action.
  
Version 0.14, January 22, 2015
  Parse and execute start, stop and quit commands received over the network.

Version 0.13, January 18, 2015
  Add the ability to receive text over the network.
  
Version 0.12, January 7, 2015
  Add a menu.  It just contains an empty preferences and Quit.
  
Version 0.11, January 4, 2015
  Add a VU meter.
  
Version 0.10, January 4, 2015
  Provide more than one sound.

Version 0.9, January 3, 2015
  Add scroll bars to the cluster section.

Version 0.8, January 2, 2015
  Have a cluster play only its own sound.  Make the GUI prettier.

Version 0.7, January 1, 2015
  Continue work on multiple clusters.
  
Version 0.6, January 1, 2015
  Start work on multiple clusters.
  
Version 0.5, January 1, 2015
  Update the copyright date, show the linked version of gtk, some minor
  cleanups.
  
Version 0.4, December 31, 2014
  Some minor improvements in comments, and some declarations in support of
  eventually handling files instead of just a test tone.

Version 0.3, December 29, 2014
  Added pan control

Version 0.2, December 28, 2014
  Improved comments, connected volume control.
	
Version 0.1, December 28, 2014
  Initial version, little more than a default project.
