Sound_effects_player is a component of ShowControl, an application to control
lighting and sound in theatrical productions.  This component plays sound
effects.

When installing on a computer running the Fedora 29 distribution of
GNU/Linux, I had to first install the following packages:

  to run autogen.sh: autoconf, automake, libtool, gtk-doc, intltool
    and glib2-devel.

  to run configure: make, libtime, gstreamer1-devel,
    gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel and gtk3-devel.

Note that libtime is not installed with dnf but is a separate component
of ShowControl.  It is also available in COPR as johnsauter / libtime.

The copy of gtk-doc.make is from /usr/share/gtk-doc/data/gtk-doc.make.
Its name changed in Fedora 28, so I copied it rather than having a
symbolic link to it.

If you wish to use JACK, you will need gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras
and qjackctl.  The sound effects player does not connect its output ports
itself, but you can use the patchbay feature of qjackctl
to cause them to connect automatically.  If JACK is not running when you start
the sound effects player you will get an error message.

On Ubuntu Studio 16.04 I had to install intltool, libgstreamer1.0-dev,
gtk+-3.0, gtk-doc-tools and libtime.  Libtime is a component of ShowControl.

This program uses custom gstreamer plugins.  To get gstreamer to load them,
execute this bash command before running the program from the command
line:

export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

Note that /usr/local/lib is the default location for the provided
gstreamer plugins; if you override libdir to install them elsewhere,
change the command line as appropriate.  If you install from COPR
you do not need this command.

If you get an error when starting the sound effects player saying that
it cannot create an element, check that this command has been executed.
When running sound_effects_player from a desktop icon, the export command
is performed automatically by the desktop environment.

If you get an error when starting the sound effects player saying that
it cannot find a library, run ldconfig as root.
