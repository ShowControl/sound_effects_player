Sound_effects_player is a component of ShowControl, an application to control
lighting and sound in theatrical productions.  This component plays sound
effects.

When installing on a Fedora 23 computer I had to first install the following
packages: gcc, intltool, gstreamer1-devel, gstreamer-plugins-base-devel,
gtk3-devel and gtk-doc.  I could then do the usual ./configure, make,
sudo make install.

On Ubuntu Studio 16.04 I had to install intltool, libgstreamer1.0-dev,
gtk+-3.0 and gtk-doc-tools.

This program uses custom gstreamer plugins.  To get gstreamer to load them,
execute this bash command before running the program:
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
