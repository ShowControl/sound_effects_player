Sound_effects_player is a component of ShowControl, an application to control
lighting and sound in theatrical productions.  This component plays sound
effects.

When installing on a Fedora 26 computer I had to first install the following
packages: gcc, intltool, gstreamer1-devel, gstreamer-plugins-base-devel,
gtk3-devel, gtk-doc and libtime.  I could then do the usual ./configure, make,
sudo make install.

If you wish to use JACK, you will need gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras
and qjackctl.  The sound effects player does not connect its output ports
itself, but you can use the patchbay feature of qjackctl
to cause them to connect automatically.  If JACK is not running when you start
the sound effects player you will get an error message.

On Ubuntu Studio 16.04 I had to install intltool, libgstreamer1.0-dev,
gtk+-3.0, gtk-doc-tools and libtime.  Libtime is a component of ShowControl.

This program uses custom gstreamer plugins.  To get gstreamer to load them,
execute this bash command before running the program:

export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

If you get an error when starting the sound effects player saying that
it cannot create an element, check that this command has been executed.

If you get an error when starting the sound effects player saying that
it cannot find a library, run ldconfig as root.
