\section{Motivation}
Low-budget live theatre uses recordings for music, rather than live
musicians, and leverages the music playing equipment (speakers,
amplifiers, a CD or similar music player) for sound effects.
The sound effects can be recorded on a CD or USB stick, and played
when needed during the performance.  This is adequate for background
sounds, but the timing is not good enough for a spot sound, such
as a slap.  In some cases these spot sounds can be made by the actors
or a backstage person using objects, but for others, such as a gun
shot, this is undesirable.  In addition, background sounds are
severely constrained: if an automobile must start its engine
while the background sounds are playing, you need a second CD
player.

Computers have become inexpensive enough in recent years that it
is reasonable to consider using one in place of the CD player
during a live performance.  With suitable software, a computer
can play both background and spot sounds, and mix them together
as needed.

I will describe how to use the sound\_effects\_player component
of the show\_control project to produce the sounds needed for
a live theatre production.

\section{What You Will Need}

To run the sound\_effects\_player you will need a computer running
the Fedora distribution of GNU/Linux.  The computer must also have
a sound card so it can output sound.  Sound\_effects\_player supports
up to eight channels of sound, but two are usually enough for Community
Theatre productions.

To get the sound\_effects\_player software, download the source tarball
from github.  It is a component of the show\_control project, at this
URL: \url{https://github.com/ShowControl/sound\_effects\_player}.
Sound\_effects\_player also requires libtime, another component of
show\_control.  Details are in the {\ttfamily .spec} file.
Alternatively, you can install the sound\_effects\_player
from copr, using john\_sauter / sound\_effects\_player.

Once you have the software installed you can look at the sample
configuration and the first three examples to learn about the
mechanics of the sound\_effects\_player and see how to make simple sounds.

\section{A Show with Complex Sound Effects}
Let us suppose that you have been asked to provide the sound effects
for a show with a challenging set of sound effects.  In addition to
the usual pre-show music and environment sounds during each scene,
there are also a variety of spot sounds that must be played
when an on-stage action happens, and some sounds must come from
the back of the audience.

The XML files developed in this paper are included with the distribution
of the sound\_effects\_player as example 4.

In order to make sounds come from behind the audience you have
borrowed two self-powered speakers on stands and positioned them
at the back of the theater.  You are using body microphones on
the actors.  These microphones go through the audio mixer and
the sound is sent equally to the two front speakers, so it seems
to the audience that it coming from the center of the stage.
The sound effects enter four channels of the audio mixer from
the computer running sound\_effects\_player.  In order to get
four sound channels out of the computer you are using a USB
sound device such as the M-Audio Fast Track Ultea 8R.
The audio mixer routes the four channels from the computer
directly to the four speakers.

The first thing we need in any sound project is the project file.
