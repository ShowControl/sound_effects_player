 abstract = {For the whole of the pre-telescopic period, eclipse observations
 have proved to be by far the best data with which to determine changes in the
 Earth's rate of rotation.  These changes -- on the scale of
 milliseconds -- are produced by both the tides and a variety of non-tidal
 mechanisms.  Each individual observation leads to a result for ΔT (the
 cumulative effect of changes in the Earth's spin rate). Over a period of many
 centuries, this parameter can attain several hours and thus can be determined
 using fairly crude observations.
 
 Recently I have extended previous investigations by introducing hitherto
 unused observations and reinterpreting some of the more reliable existing
 data: especially in the periods from 700 BC to 50 BC and from AD 300 to 800.
 This has led to the derivation of revised ΔT values over much of the
 historical period.}

 abstract = {Observed values of the difference between the time determined
 using the rotation of the Earth and a uniform time scale are available since
 1627, with useful observations becoming available in 1656.
 These early data were recorded with low precision and must be smoothed
 numerically in order to be useful for the derivation of estimates of the
 difference between the actual length of the day and the standard 24 h,
 known as excess length of day, or the Earth's rotational speed.
 Modern data requires no smoothing. The observational data have been adjusted
 to be consistent with one estimate of the lunar acceleration and smoothed
 so that the internal and external precision of the observations are
 approximately equal. The final values along with the derived excess length of
 day are presented and their spectra are discussed.

 zonal tides on the Earth's rotation, which includes ocean-tidal effects,
 adequately accounts for the observations of the high-frequency
 (periods between one and 30 days) variations in the length of day at the
 present level of accuracy. A currently unexplained semi-annual variation
 in the length of day remains, but this may be due to the unmodelled effects
 of stratospheric winds. The power spectrum of the remaining variations with
 periods less than 20 days is essentially that of a white-noise process.
 The amplitudes of the remaining unexplained variations in length of day are
 less than 30 microseconds.},

 abstract = {Fluctuations in the Earth's rotation since 1830, as evidenced by
             changes in the length of the day, are derived from astronomical
	     data having subannual resolution. Before 1955.5, timings of lunar
	     occultations are used; after 1955.5, the data are taken from the
	     time series TAI-UT1. Although the data in the earliest period,
	     1830–90, display decade fluctuations in the length of the day,
	     they are not accurate enough to reveal interannual variations.
	     In this regard, also, the results from 1890–1925 are somewhat
	     dubious. The quality of the data after 1925, though, is such
	     that the temporal behaviour of the interannual fluctuations in
	     the length of the day can be traced with confidence. We present
	     plots of the interannual fluctuations in the period 1890–1987
	     and the longer-term decade fluctuations in the period 1830–1983.
	     The interannual fluctuations in the length of the day since 1925
	     are compared with an index of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation
	     (ENSO) phenomenon in the ocean-atmosphere system and are
	     subjected to spectral analysis. The results support the
	     conclusions reached by other authors that these fluctuations are
	     linked to circulation changes in the atmosphere associated with
	     ENSO, and in part to the quasi-biennial oscillation in the
	     equatorial stratosphere's zonal winds. A spectral analysis of our
	     62 yr series of length of day values since 1925 reveals two
	     significant peaks in the interannual range 2–4 yr.
	     One is roughly biennial and the other is about twice this period,
	     broadly supporting results obtained previously from shorter
	     records.  Our analysis of high-resolution data, therefore,
	     contributes to ongoing efforts to establish a close relationship
	     between the length of the day and aspects of the global climate
	     system in the period before modern data became available in
	     1955.5.},

	It is found that the rate of rotation departs from uniformity,

	increases at an average rate of $+1.8$ ms per century.
	This is significantly less than the rate predicted on the basis of

	Besides this linear change in the lod, there are fluctuations

	A power spectral density analysis of fluctuations in the

	and there is evidence of increased power at a period of 6 years.
